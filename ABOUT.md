# Unreal Fortress 2
Unreal Fortress 2 is an Team Fortress 2 Remake With the Intent of Making Team Fortress 2 Accessable to Older Hardware as Team Fortress 2 is Poor Running Game Due to It Running on the Outdated Source Engine,

Due to VALVe's Gross Negligence to the TF2 Community as Shown By the TF2 Bot Crisis That Lasted for 7 Years (Save TF2 Website Here for More Info https://save.tf/) UF2 is Meant for the Team Fortress Community to Have Something New Running on a Modern Engine,

# Why This Matters

As TF2 remains Alive VALVe Creates More and More Mircotransations And Resricted the New Players (aka F2Ps) From Chatting, Voice Chat, And Voice Commands as an Attempt to Prevent Bots from Sending Mallous Content But was Bypassed thsnks to Bots Being Premium Which Left a Huge Impact for F2Ps Also the Game haden't Receive a Major Update by VALVe which is why Unreal Fortress 2 is Being Developed,
