# UnrealFortress2
Unreal Fortress 2 is an Team Fortress 2 Remake With the Intent of Making Team Fortress 2 Accessable to Older Hardware as Team Fortress 2 is Poor Running Game Due to It Running on the Outdated Source Engine,

Due to VALVe's Gross Negligence to the TF2 Community as Shown By the TF2 Bot Crisis That Lasted for 7 Years (Save TF2 Website Here for More Info https://save.tf/) UF2 is Meant for the Team Fortress Community to Have Something New Running on a Modern Engine
